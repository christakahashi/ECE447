    "**Instructions:** Make a copy of this notebook that you can edit and save. If you are using CoLab, that means clicking File>Save and then \"SAVE A COPY IN DRIVE\". Then, for each problem, insert your answers directly underneath the problem description as one or more `Code` or `Markdown` cells as appropriate. Every code cell should execute without errors. TAs and graders may not have resources to debug your code. When you are satisfied with your answers upload your notebook to canvas. "
